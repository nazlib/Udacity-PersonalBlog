                    <strong>Vincent Willem Van Gogh</strong>
                    </br>
                    was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and
                    influential
                    figures in
                    the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
                    paintings,
                    most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes,
                    portraits
                    and
                    self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
                    brushwork
                    that
                    contributed to the foundations of modern art.
                    He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness,
                    depression
                    and
                    poverty.
